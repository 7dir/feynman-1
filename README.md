# feynman
A javascript application for creating feynman diagrams. Live at [feynman.aivazis.com](http://feynman.aivazis.com).

This repo started as a migration of my [original](https://github.com/AlecAivazis/feynman-old) feynman diagram 
application to a leaner flask server. It then evolved from a [badly written angular 1.2 application](https://github.com/AlecAivazis/feynman/tree/angular1.x) to a less-badly
written react/redux app.

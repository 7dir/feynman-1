# feynman
A javascript application for creating feynman diagrams. Live at [feynman.aivazis.com](http://feynman.aivazis.com).

This repo started as a migration of my [original](https://github.com/AlecAivazis/feynman-old) feynman diagram 
application to a leaner flask server. Then, it then evolved from a badly written angular 1.2 application to a less-badly
written react/redux app. There is still [some work](https://github.com/AlecAivazis/feynman/projects/1) to do before I can flip the switch on the deployed version, but stay tuned!

A preview of thew new, react-driven application can be found [here](https://warrior-tortoise-70216.netlify.com/).
